    <h2 id="Carrer">Carrer</h2>
    <p>Early career and breakthrough (1979–2003)
        At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao
        shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. Needa
        marked his debut as a child actor.[16] In 1983, he acted in Poratam (1983) upon being requested by its director
        Kodi Ramakrishna.[17] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988),
        Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram
        (1989). Babu then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990).[17][18]

        In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the romantic comedy Rajakumarudu, and people began referring
        to him with the title Prince.[19] For his performance, he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[20] He
        starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi, where he was paired opposite Namrata
        Shirodkar.[21][22] He also starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari (2001) opposite Sonali Bendre, which he regarded as
        an important film in his career.[23][24] For his role in Murari, he earned a Nandi Special Jury Award, in
        addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[20] A critic from Sify stated,
        "Both Mahesh and Sonali Bendre look charming and Mahesh is in his elements as light-hearted prankster."[25]

        In 2002, his performance in Takkari Donga landed him his second Nandi Special Jury Award.[20] He had two film
        releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla.[26] He won his first
        Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[27] The other release was Nijam
        co-starring Rakshita.[28] Babu received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of
        Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed "a routine tale of
        vendetta".[29] He won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, in addition to his
        third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[30]</p>
    <h2 id="Educational-life">Educational life</h2>
    <p>Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu was born on 9 August 1975 in a Telugu family to actor Krishna and Indira in Madras,
        Tamil Nadu.[9][10][11][12] He is the fourth of five siblings, after Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi, and Manjula, and
        before Priyadarsini. His family hails from Burripalem in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.[13]

        Mahesh spent his childhood mostly in Madras under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of
        his family.[14] He was educated at the St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He went on to
        pursue a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the Loyola College, Chennai</p>
    <h2 id="Marriage">Marriage</h2>
    <p>Mahesh Babu married his co-star Namrata Shirodkar on 10 February 2005 at Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the
        shooting of Athadu (2005).[155] They have a son, Gautam, and a daughter, Sitara.[156][157] Gautam portrayed the
        younger version of Mahesh Babu in 1: Nenokkadine (2014).[citation needed] Sitara voiced young Elsa in the Telugu
        dub of Frozen 2 (2019).[158]

        Mahesh is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and
        was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and
        Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[159] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer,
        director, and an actress.[160] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his
        debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[16</p>
    <h2 id="Achivements">Achivements</h2>
    <p>Babu's next film was the political action drama Bharat Ane Nenu in 2018 where he played the role of a chief
        minister opposite Kiara Advani.[94] His performance in the film earned him his tenth nomination for the Filmfare
        Award for Best Actor – Telugu. His next film was Maharshi in 2019 opposite Pooja Hegde.[95] Hemanth Kumar of
        Firstpost mentioned the film owes a lot to Mahesh Babu's conviction to pull off his role and he makes you
        believe in his characterisation so much that it doesn't feel like fiction.[96] Both the films were commercial
        success and ranks among the highest grossing Telugu films of their respective years.[97] After the release of
        the film, the concept of weekend farming (also known as weekend agriculture) gained more attention.[98] A new
        internet challenge. i.e. Agriculture Challenge was started, with several people do farming in the weekends.[99]
        The Statesman reported that the film has created a social impact on the youth and raised awareness about the
        issues faced by farmers in the rural heartland.[100] In February 2020, Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge
        Technologies organised the contest "Campus Farming". 250 students of the university participated in this
        contest.[101]

        Babu performed in the 2020 film Sarileru Neekevvaru opposite Rashmika Mandanna, earning him an eleventh
        nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[102] The satellite rights of the film were sold to
        Gemini TV,[103] which premiered it on 25 March 2020 for the first time on eve of Ugadi and in its first
        Television premier movie recorded a TRP of 23.4.[104] Neeshita Nyayapati stated that Babu did a "good job of
        playing a man who will serve the country, crack jokes and protect".[105] The film was a major commercial success
        ranking as the one of the highest grossing Telugu film of all time. It remains Babu's highest grossing
        release.[106]

        With no film in 2021, Babu's next film Sarkaru Vaari Paata, marking his maiden collaboration with director
        Parasuram was released in 2022, opposite Keerthy Suresh.[107] The film was released in May 2022 to mixed reviews
        from critics. Balakrishna Ganeshan of The News Minute wrote "It is great to see Mahesh Babu shedding his macho
        image and wooing a woman in the film. Mahesh is a delight to watch in these scenes. His comic timing and
        dialogue delivery are on point".[108][109] Haricharan Pudipeddi of the Hindustan Times stated "Mahesh Babu
        offers something fresh in his latest film."[110] A commercial success, it was one of the year's highest grossing
        film.[111] Babu then produced Major under by G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment, a film based on the life of Major
        Sandeep Unnikrishnan who was martyred in action in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in the same year.[112][113]

        With no release in 2023, Babu reunited with Trivikram Srinivas for their third collaboration in the film Guntur
        Kaaram, opposite Sreeleela, which was released in 2024.[114] The movie was a financial failure and received
        mostly negative reviews, but Babu's performance was praised.[115] Although his performance in the song "Kurchi
        Madathapetti" was widely appreciated.[116] Babu will next appear in S. S. Rajamouli's film alongside Priyanka
        Chopra and Prithviraj Sukumaran.[citation needed]</p>
